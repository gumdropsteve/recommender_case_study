# Movie Recommender Case Study

Today you are going to have a little friendly competition with your classmates.

You are going to building a recommendation system based off data from the MovieLens dataset. It includes movie information, user information, and the users' ratings. Your goal is to build a recommendation system and to suggest movies to users!

The movies data and user data are in data/movies.dat and data/users.dat.

The ratings data can be found in data/training.csv. The users' ratings have been broken into a training and test set for you (to obtain the testing set, we have split the 20% of the most recent ratings).
